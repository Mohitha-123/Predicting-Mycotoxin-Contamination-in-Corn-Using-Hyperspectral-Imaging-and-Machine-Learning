**Predicting Mycotoxin Contamination in Corn Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Machine Learning**

Overview:

This project processes hyperspectral imaging data to predict mycotoxin levels (e.g., DON concentration) in corn samples. The workflow includes:
-- Preprocessing the hyperspectral dataset

-- Visualizing spectral bands to explore data characteristics

-- Performing dimensionality reduction using PCA or t-SNE

-- Training machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or a simple neural network

-- Evaluating model performance and generating actionable insights

Installation:

To set up the environment and install dependencies, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
